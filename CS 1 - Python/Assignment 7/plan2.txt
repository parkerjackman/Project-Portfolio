Requirement Specifications
    Input
        Coordinates of center and radius for two different circles
    output
        Whether the circles are not touching, if they are overlapping, or if one is inside the other
        (if one is inside the other state which one is inside)

System Analysis
    distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)
    distance = radius1 + radius2 when the circles barely touch at one point
    distance = abs(radius1 - radius2) when one is inside the other with the smaller circle touching the larger one

System Design
    Ask for coordinates of center and radii for circles
    Calculate distance
    Compare distance to relations in System Analysis
    Print relation of circles

Testing

  Test 1
    Input:
        x1, y1 = 1, 1
        radius1 = 4
        x2, y2 = 10, 15
        radius2 = 5
    output:
        The circles are not touching.

  Test 2
    Input:
        x1, y1 = 2, 1
        radius1 = 5
        x2, y2 = 4, 4
        radius2 = 6
    output:
        The circles are overlapping.

  Test 3
    Input:
        x1, y1 = 4, 4
        radius1 = 2
        x2, y2 = 0, 0
        radius2 = 10
    output:
        Circle 1 is inside circle 2.
