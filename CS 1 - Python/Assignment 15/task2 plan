Requirement Specification
    Prompt the user for the number of players. This does not include the dealer. You may have 1 - 5 players
    Each player starts with $100 in their account
    A player can continue until they are out of money
    Each round
    Prompt each player one at a time for their bet amount.
        Display the current balance for each user as part of their prompt
        The minimum bet is $5 or their entire balance, whichever is lower
    Deal the cards
        Each round will have a fresh deck of shuffled cards
        Cards are dealt one at a time beginning with player 1 and ending with the dealer
        Each player (including the dealer) gets two cards, meaning there will be two cycles of dealing cards to each player.
    After dealing all cards display the dealer's second card
    For each player starting with player 1
        Show the player hand
        Ask the player if they'd hit (take another card) or hold
        Repeat until they hold or bust (total of cards is over 21)
        If they bust they lose
        If the player holds then the next player goes
    After all players are done the dealer complete its turn
        Display both dealer cards (print each on a new line)
        Use time.sleep() to wait for 1 second before dealing another card(s) to the dealer
        The dealer must take a card until its total is 17 or higher
        If the dealer's initial hand is 17 or higher it does not take a card
        Use appropriate messages so the players know what the dealer is doing
        Ex: "The dealer takes a card" / "The dealer busts" / "The dealer holds"
    Determining winners
        If the dealer busts (goes over 21), all players who did not bust win
        If the player and dealer totals are the same they tie
        If the players hand is lower than the dealer, the player loses
        Use appropriate messages to let each player know what their result is
    Player payouts
        Win - add the amount bet to the player's balance
        Tie - neither add nor subtract from he player's balance
        Lose - subtract the amount bet from the player's balance
        Display each user's balance (including those who have lost all their money)
    Ask to Play again
        Yes: Repeat the round for all players with a positive balance
        No
            Print a Thank You message
            Print each player's name (their player number) and balance starting with the one with the highest.
            You should perform a sort first.

System Design
    Get number of players
    Big loop for each round
        Loop to get each active player's bet
        Go through each active player's turn
            show dealer's second card
            show player's hand
            hit or hold
            if hit
                add another card
                add card value to hand
                show new hand
                check if busted
                continue turn if didn't bust
            if hold
                next player's turn
        Dealer's turn
            show dealer's hand
            wait one second
            if dealer hand less than 17 add another card
                continue these steps until either the dealer hand is between 17 and 21 or busts
        payout
            if dealer busts
                everyone who didn't bust gets paid their bet
            if dealer doesn't bust
                everyone who beat the dealer but didn't bust gets paid their bet
                everyone who busted or lost to the dealer loses their bet
        Ask if want to play again
            if yes, continue loop for next round with active players
            if no exit loop

    Once players exit game loop print thank you message with results
        create players list with length of number of players with [1, 2, 3, ...]
        insertion sort with accounts to sort from highest to lowest
            every time a change is made, make same change in players list

        loop to print results

Testing

  Test 1
    Play with 3 players
    player 1 bets 80
    player 2 bets 10
    player 3 bets 50

    make every player bust then exit game after 1st round

    expected results:
        Player 2 ended with $90
        Player 3 ended with $50
        Player 1 ended with $20

  Test 2
    play with 3 players
    players 1 and 3 bets 10
    player 2 bets 100

    player 1 and 3 try not to bust, but no problem if they do
    player 2 hit until bust

    continue to 2nd round
        only player 1 and 3 should be playing

    keep making small bets until one player beats dealer
        account should increase by proper bet

    after a player beats dealer once exit game loop to see results

  Problems: None
