Requirement Specifications
    input:
        stay or switch
    output:
        You won x times
        You won n% of the time

System Analysis
    stay = 1
    switch = 2
    for loop testing if door choice wins
    win_percent = times_won / 100000

System Design
    define play game function
        car door = random number (1 or 2)
        decision = stay or switch
            stay = door 1
            switch = door 2
        for loop 100,000 times
            if car door = decision
                player won
                add 1 to times won
            else
                continue
        win percent = times_won / 100000
        print times won
        print win percent

    again = "y"

    while loop for again = y
        ask player if they want to play again (y or n)
        make input lower case

Testing

    Stay:
        You won 33333 times
        You won 33.33% of the time

    switch
        You won 66666 times
        You won 66.67% of the time

    if they don't play again
        print "Thanks for playing!"
