Requirement Specifications
    Find and display the 4 perfect numbers less than 10,000
    Print total running time of the program in seconds
    Print number of iterations performed by inner loop
        Goal is less than 16 million iterations

System Analysis
    start timing
    loop count is 10000
    while loop from i = 1 to i = 10000
    for loop testing each number (j) up to half of i to see if j is a multiple of i
    stop timing
    run time = stop - start

System Design
    import timeit
    start timing

    i = 1
    LOOP_COUNT = 10000
    inner loop starts at 0

    while loop i < LOOP_COUNT
        sum starts at 0
        test number is one more than half of i (so j reaches half of i
        for loop testing if j is a multiple of i. range from 1 to half of i
            if j is a multiple of i
                add current value of j to sum
            else
                continue
        if sum == i
            print that i is a perfect number
        add 1 to i to test next number

Testing

    Expected output
        6 is a perfect number
        28 is a perfect number
        496 is a perfect number
        8128 is a perfect number
        The inner loop ran <number> iterations
        the program took <number> seconds to execute
