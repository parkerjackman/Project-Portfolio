Requirement Specifications
    Input
        Which mode:
            1: rectangle pattern
                center coordinates, offset, width, height, rotation
            2: circle pattern
                center coordinates, offset, radius
            3: Super pattern
                number of patterns

    Output
        ring of specified shapes of random color.
            random shape and variables in super pattern mode

System Design
    import random
    import turtle

    define reset()
        turtle.reset()

    define setup()
        set fast speed
        set screen to 1000 x 800

    define define drawRectanglePattern()
        loop 'count' times
            go to center coordinates
            set header
            forward offset
            rotate according to input
            set random color
            draw rectangle with given height and width
            rotate heading 360 / count


    define drawRectangle()
        forward width
        left 90
        forward height
        left 90
        forward width
        left 90
        forward height
        left 90

    define drawCirclePattern()
        loop 'count' times
            go to center coordinates
            set header
            forward offset
            rotate 90 degrees right
            set random color
            draw circle with given radius


    define drawSuperPattern()
        loop num times
            pick rectangle pattern or circle pattern randomly
            draw pattern with all parameters random within reasonable range


    define setRandomColor()
        pick random number between 1 and 3
        different color for each number

    define done()
        turtle.done()

Testing

  Test 1
    Mode 1
    center coordinates: 0, 0
    height: 20
    width: 5
    offset: 15
    rotation: 30
    number of rectangles: 30
    play again? 1

    Expected output
        circle of 30 randomly colored rectangles with width and height as above.
        Closest corner of rectangles should be 15 away from 0, 0
        with each rectangle rotated 30 degrees from radial vector

        Then it should ask which mode you want again with rectangle pattern still there

  Test 2
    Mode 2
    Center Coordinates:100, -50
    Offset: -50
    Radius: 75
    count: 100
    play again? 2

    Expected output
        ring of 100 randomly colored circles with radius 75 and closest edge 50 away from 100, -50
        since offset is negative, drawing should start on left side rather than right

        Then it should ask which mode you want again with pattern erased

  Test 3
    Mode 3
    number of patterns: 5

    Expected output
        5 rings in various spots each one either a circle pattern or rectangle pattern with all parameters random


    Problems: NONE
